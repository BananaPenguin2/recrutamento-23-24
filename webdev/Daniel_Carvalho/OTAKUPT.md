# WEBDEV PROJECT 2023/2024 RECRUITMENT

The application can be executed, while in the directory, by running the LiveServer add-on of VSCODE, and opening on the localhost port indicated. An alternative is to open the index.html with a Web Browser (Chrome is recommended since it was developed in that one)

There are two main files, ```index.html```, that contains all the html used in the site, and ```styles.css```, that cotains all the styles used in the Web Page.

This project was not made to be compatible to every browser and for Dark Mode.

This project was done in an effort to train the basic skills of html and css, by copying the main website of https://www.otakupt.com/ , recomended by a friend.

Since I do not have as much experience and knowledge with JavaScript as with CSS and HTML, it was 
mainly sourced from other avenues, such as ChatGPT and W3SChools.

It is not a perfect replica, for example, my categories (anime, manga, etc. in the top of the page) popup
have a darker background since I thought it would be more asthetically apeasing, in the footing, the boxes of social media are smaller as well, and in main grid of news, the links to the pages are not touching each other but separate, which means tthat the gaps are not associated to a link, as it is in
the original.

The website was also not made to be opened in Smartphones or smaller browser windows. 

Overall, in the header and footer FlexBox was mainly used, while in the main body Grid was used. 
Position was used mainly for popups.

In the file ```images```, there exists severals icons in the format of .svg, used throughout the site, beign sourced from Google Material Icons, Bootsrap Icons and IconMonstr. There also exists the favicon.
There exists a directory called ```news```, that houses the images used to indicate news, some being re-used in several places.

The website was done to have a max-width of 1030px, since it looked like they were using around the same
size for max-width, maybe slightly larger in main content. It was made this way so it does not stretch the images used to adapt to size of the monitor it is rendered.

My website has a different font, since, even though I did not copy all of the options they had fro their
website, I copied some of what they have, but didn't render the same. Probably had to link some of those fonts in header of the HTML. But since it can be a copy that is different then the original, I went with the font that i thought was fitting.
